      If we want to understand CRISPR, we should go back to <strong>1987</strong>, when Japanese scientists studying E. coli bacteria first came across some unusual repeating sequences in the organism’s DNA. “The biological significance of these sequences,” they
      wrote, “is unknown.” Over time, other researchers found similar clusters in the DNA of other bacteria (and archaea). They gave these sequences a name: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats — or CRISPR.
    </p>


    <p>
      Yet the function of these CRISPR sequences was mostly a mystery until <strong>2007</strong>, when food scientists studying the Streptococcus bacteria used to make yogurt showed that these odd clusters actually served a vital function: They’re part of the
      bacteria’s immune system.
    </p>


    <p>
      In <strong>2011</strong>, Jennifer Doudna of the University of California Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier of Umeå University in Sweden were puzzling over how the CRISPR/Cas9 system actually worked. How did the Cas9 enzyme match the RNA in the mug shots with
      that in the viruses? How did the enzymes know when to start chopping?
    </p>

    <p>
      The scientists soon discovered they could “fool” the Cas9 protein by feeding it artificial RNA — a fake mug shot. When they did that, the enzyme would search for anything with that same code, not just viruses, and start chopping. In a
      landmark <strong>2012</strong> paper, Doudna, Charpentier, and Martin Jinek showed they could use this CRISPR/Cas9 system to cut up any genome at any place they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the technique had only been demonstrated on molecules in test tubes at that point, the implications were breathtaking.
    </p>

    <p>


      Further advances followed. Feng Zhang, a scientist at the Broad Institute in Boston, co-authored a paper in Science in February <strong>2013</strong> showing that CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to edit the genomes of cultured mouse cells or human cells. In the
      same issue of Science, Harvard’s George Church and his team showed how a different CRISPR technique could be used to edit human cells.
